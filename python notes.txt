Rules to define identifiers
---------------------------------

1) [a-zA-Z0-9]
2) it cannot be started with a number but can contain number
3) it cannot be any keyword name
4) only one special chaarcter is allowed i.e. _ (underscore)

operators 
------------
Operator is symbol 

1) Arithemtic operators 
+,-,*,/,%,//,**

/ -- Normal divsion -- quotient
// - floor division -- quotient
% - modulo/modulus/mod -- remainder
** - exponential operator/power operator

Normal division operators, always gives you output in float 

floor diviosn says:
	1) if any of the operand is float only then result will be in float
	2) if both the operands are integer then u will get integer asnwer only. It will never do a complete division.  



Assignment operators 
------------------------

=, +=, -=, *=

comparison operators 
-------------------------

==, >=,<=,>,<,!=

Logical operators 

and or not 
----------------------------------
Immutability vs mutabiltiy
----------------------------------

Immutabiltiy -- You cannot change an exisitng object ( Non changable) 


We have two execution modes in python

1) Interactive Mode
2) Script Mode


How we can access the characters of string
1) Indexing 
2) Slicing

Python supports both positive and negative indexing. 

We use square brackets [] for indexing, it starts from 0 (forward direction -- left to right)

-ve indexing means bakcward direction that means right to left it starts from -1


Whenever we want to use + operator for string compulsory both arguments should be string only. --- string concatenation. 

String repetition -- compulsory we should have one string and other is int. 



control flow statements
1) conditional statements/ decision making -- if else, elif
2) iterative statements (loops) -- while, for
3) Jump statements/Transfer statements -- break, continue


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

print()
type()
input()

By default data type of input() is string.

Typecasting ---- Means converting one data type to another.  

eval() ---- Automatically detects which data type u r providing.




for i in range(5,51,5):
        print(i)
