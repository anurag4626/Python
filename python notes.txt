Rules to define identifiers
---------------------------------

1) [a-zA-Z0-9]
2) it cannot be started with a number but can contain number
3) it cannot be any keyword name
4) only one special chaarcter is allowed i.e. _ (underscore)

operators 
------------
Operator is symbol 

1) Arithemtic operators 
+,-,*,/,%,//,**

/ -- Normal divsion -- quotient
// - floor division -- quotient
% - modulo/modulus/mod -- remainder
** - exponential operator/power operator

Normal division operators, always gives you output in float 

floor diviosn says:
	1) if any of the operand is float only then result will be in float
	2) if both the operands are integer then u will get integer asnwer only. It will never do a complete division.  



Assignment operators 
------------------------

=, +=, -=, *=

comparison operators 
-------------------------

==, >=,<=,>,<,!=

Logical operators 

and or not 
----------------------------------
Immutability vs mutabiltiy
----------------------------------

Immutabiltiy -- You cannot change an exisitng object ( Non changable) 


We have two execution modes in python

1) Interactive Mode
2) Script Mode


How we can access the characters of string
1) Indexing 
2) Slicing

Python supports both positive and negative indexing. 

We use square brackets [] for indexing, it starts from 0 (forward direction -- left to right)

-ve indexing means bakcward direction that means right to left it starts from -1


Whenever we want to use + operator for string compulsory both arguments should be string only. --- string concatenation. 

String repetition -- compulsory we should have one string and other is int. 



control flow statements
1) conditional statements/ decision making -- if else, elif
2) iterative statements (loops) -- while, for
3) Jump statements/Transfer statements -- break, continue


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

print()
type()
input()

By default data type of input() is string.

Typecasting ---- Means converting one data type to another.  

eval() ---- Automatically detects which data type u r providing.

         print(" "*(x-i),end="")
         print("*"*i)


## WAP to find out of the number is armstrong or not.
x=input("enter number") ## 153
y=len(x)   ## 3
count=0 
for i in range(y):
        count=count+int(x[i])**y
        print(count)
if count==int(x):
     print(x,"is armstong value")
else:
    print("not a armstong value")


## WAP to find all armstrong numbers between 2 to 1000.


Slicing 
---------------------------
[start:end:step]


start -- start index value
end --   end index value
step - increment.  



>>> x = "DB-01"
>>> x[0:3:2]
When ever step value is +ve,forward direction (left to right)

When ever step value is +ve, end index will become end-1.
if start value is not given, default value is 0.
if end value is not given, it will take till last character, but you dont need to do end-1 here.
is step value is not given, default value is 1.


Step value -ve
It will be in backward direction ( right to left)

if step value is -ve, end will become end+1.
If end value is not given, it will take till last character from backward direction and there will be no end+1.
if start index is not given, default value is -1.

## Q. What is shallow copy and deep copy 
## What is list aliasing


## Tuples

1) it is collection of hetrogeneous elements
2) it allows duplicate items
3) It is immutable (Non changable)


## Paranthesis is optional in tuple, important is commna

t = ("red","green","orange")

## Two functions of tuple

	count -- it will find number of occurence of element
	index -- It will find the index value of the particular element. 
	
	
## Adding numbers in tuple using eval function 	
	
k = eval(input("enter the numbers"))
j=0
for i in k:
       j=j+i;
print(j)

## 

Set 

update function --- to add multiple items in the set 
	this should be iterable objects like list, string etc. 

## Write a program to print differenet vowels present inside in the given word. 

a = input("enter the word")
k = set(a)
l = {"a","e","i","o","u",}
print("common elements are",k&l)
